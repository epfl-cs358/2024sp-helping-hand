## Project's Overview

Helping Hand is an innovative project designed to enhance the independence of individuals with mobility impairments through adaptable home automation.
The core of the project is a modular box equipped with a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller and a plotter-like mechanism that allows remote control of various household appliances.
This system can be operated via a smartphone app, making it accessible for users with limited physical capabilities.

Inspired by the needs of Sean, a person with ALS who has limited mobility, Helping Hand aims to facilitate tasks such as opening doors and operating blinds without assistance.
The modular box can accommodate different remote controls, allowing users to control multiple devices through a single, user-friendly interface.
The project prioritizes accessibility, ease of use, and adaptability, making it a versatile solution for various remote-controlled appliances.
